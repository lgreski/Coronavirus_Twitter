This repo contains COVID19 Twitter data, roughly 1.5 million tweets containing #coronavirus, #covid19, #stayhome, #socialdistancing, or #flattenthecurve hashtags and posted between March 9 and April 3. The data only include tweets from users whose profiles include valid locations, and these users were geolocated using Google Maps API. All rows include long, lat information, as well as a "Type" field, which reads "U" for users in Urbanized Areas (cities, suburbs) and "C" for users in Urban Clusters (small towns, rural communities).
